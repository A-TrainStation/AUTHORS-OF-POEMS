Bouncing Ideas off a wall, 2 day's later I helped the mall.
Have any concerns please call, I will see you Next Years Fall.
Moving on to something good, reading books like Red Riding Hood.
Looking back at who I am, thanking my town as my fans.
Feeling stronger like a man. Having such a great Career, couldn't done it without my fears.
At least everyone's gone through tears. Taking Words of advice from me, don't you worry your safe with me.
Come to me and 1 / 1 1 show you, see. Picking out one Memory, being with my family.
Hope you all decide to agree. Staying with my easy flow, one wrong turn and your down below.
Why is every answer No?. Please C'mon my heart is low.
Taking someone out tonight, love the kindness and polite. Has someone told you're bright.
Sending wish cards overseas, having my family come see. The entire family tree.
Stopping at a perfect time, really shares joy in my Rhymes, hate when people do bad Crimes.
Selling out my works of art, turning scratch in a new fresh start.
Taking these words from my heart, hopes this song never falls apart.
THIS IS MY MOMENT WITH YOU, ONE LAST THING LETS ALL STAY TRUE.`;
